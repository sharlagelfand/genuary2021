# Genuary 2022

## Day 1: Draw 10,000 of something

![A series of overlapping squares. Each square consists of vertical or horizontal lines, colored in bright blue, green, orange, pinks, and yellows. The lines are not full opacity, so you can see the layers of squares and lines.](01/day_1_noisy_small.png)

## Day 2: Dithering

Gunta St√∂lzl's [Design for a runner](https://2016kingscliffgreendesign.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/gunta-sholzl/)

![A long horizontal design color blocked with various greens, oranges, yellow, and white. There is some fluidity to the design, and the yellow and white blocks are more curved than square. Some of the blocks are patterned with polka dots or stripes. The image is dithered, so the number of overall colors is reduced and the image is represented more in pixels and cross hatches than a smooth photograph would be.](02/gunta_stolzl_2_dither.png)

## Day 3: Space

![A generative image of space. The background is a noisy black to dark grey gradient with tiny randomly placed stars. There are three blobby planets - a dark blue one, a red one, and an orange one in the distance.](03/day_3_noisy_small.png)

## Day 4: The next next Fidenza

![A horizontal image of blobby shapes, alternating in colors of lime green and baby blue to dark blue. There is some flow to the blobs, since their placement is derived from perlin noise.](04/bluegreens_noisy_small.png)

## Day 6: Trade styles with a friend

Referencing (blatantly) Ijeamaka Anyene's [work](https://twitter.com/ijeamaka_a/status/1454885928967696387)

![A set of 4 panels in a combination of vertical and horizontal layout. Each panel is a solid blue square with a thick lime green border and a thinner blue border around that. Within each panel is a bunch of small lime green circles, varying in size and placed randomly. The circles are contained within each panel but there is some overlap with the panels' borders and small number peeking out. On those peeking out, you can see that the circles have a blue border.](06/day_6_noisy_small.png)

## Day 7: Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings

Inspired by [Wall Drawing 413](https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing413/)

![24 sets of squares laid out in 8 columns and 3 rows. Each set contains 4 squares (2 columns and 2 rows), and each square contains 4 squares within it - one red, one lime green, one pink, and one dark blue. The first squares within each sets are all of the possible permutations of the colour placements. The remaining 3 squares in each set are rotations of the first square (i.e. the square mirrored on the x axis, on the y axis, and on both the x and y axes).](07/day_7_noisy_small.png)

## Day 9: Architecture

Inspired by the cover of ["Making Room: Women and Architecture"](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/women-feminism-american-architecture/), an edition of the feminist journal Heresies published in 1981

![A black, red, and white image with a noisy black background and thick white border. There are randomly placed rectangles of various sizes, whose borders are jagged and random. Some of the rectangles are white on the inside, some contain a grid (in black or red), and some contain a checkerboard pattern (also in black or red). The grids and checkerboards are of various sizes.](09/day_9_clean_420.png)

## Day 11: No computer

![A series of sketches planning for genuary. Each sketch starts with a small square that contains a pattern (e.g. a semi circle, a quarter circle, or a series of lines, squares, and circles). Beside each pattern is a coloured drawing, where the pattern is repeated over and over (and sometimes flipped horizontally or vertically) to form a larger pattern. The patterns are primarily coloured using various pinks and greens, but some use blue, purple, and yellow. Some of the drawings are annotated in dark blue, showing what one "unit" of the pattern is and how the other parts are made (e.g. by flipping on x, flipping on y, or flipping on both x and y).](11/day_11.png)

## Day 12: Packing

![Assorted circle-ish blob shapes, varying in size and color (dark blue, orange, purple, baby blue, red, lime green, pink, etc). Some of the blobs are very big and some are very small. They are closely packed together but none are overlapping.](12/day_12_clean.png)

## Day 13: 80x800

![A set of eight squares laid out 4 across and 2 down, packed tightly together. Each square contains 10 strips that all run either horizontally or vertically. Each strip is a gradient from one color to another. Some of the gradients run in the same direction as the strip (e.g. a horizontal strip with a gradient running horizontally) and some are in the opposite direction (e.g. a horizontal strip with a vertical gradient). In the strips where the gradient direction matches the strip direction, it is clearer that there is some flow between the colours - e.g. orange runs from the left into pink on the right, and the next strip down, pink runs from the left into blue on the right, and so on. The colours are saturated and bright, including lime green, pink, a bright dark blue, red, orange, and more.](13/day_13_small.png)

## Day 15: Sand

![A grainy pastel image with assorted squares coloured in soft purple, blue, pinks, and yellows. On top of the squares is a random and large wavy pattern, overlapping itself in thin purple lines and slightly thicker, more transparent purple lines. The lines of the waves form bands with more pastel colours between them. On an offset grid pattern on top of everything there are slightly transparent squares with angled pink starfish in the middle.](15/day_15_small.png)

## Day 16: Color gradients gone wrong

![A circular image of various gradients, arranged in an outer circle and an inner circle. Both the outer and inner circle are split into 4 equal pieces, and each piece contains strips that look either like slivers of a pie, or rings of a circle, in an alternating pattern. Each of those strips contains a gradient. The gradient colours are bright but soft, including light pink, orange, light blue, and lime green. The background of the image is a gradient from lime green to light blue.](16/day_16_small.png)

## Day 17: 3 colors

![An 8.5x11 image of blobby pink strawberries with green stems, against a rectangular pink background. Some of the strawberries and their stems peek over the perimeter of the pink background. The image has a multiply effect so that the colours look overlay on top of each other - the same pink is used for the strawberries and the background, but two layers of the same pink create a darker pink. Similarly, where the green stems are overlaid on the pink strawberries, a darker shade of murky green is created. Behind each strawberry is a white outline of the strawberry and stem, filled with a light pink dotted halftone pattern. The halftone pattern is also visible through the strawberries due to the multiply effect.](17/day_17_small.png)

## Day 19: Use text/typography

![A large checkerboard pattern in light blue and lime green. The image is textured and almost looks like a swatch of fabric.]()

## Day 26: Airport carpet

![A pattern formed by various pink, red, yellow, and orange squares, circles, and polygons. The pattern ends up looking like a pink sun or star with a red center. The pattern is textured, like a rug, and the edges are frayed.]()

## Day 29: Isometric perspective

![Various red, pink, orange, and yellow buildings laid out in an isometric grid. The buildings are contained within five "blocks", with a little sidewalk on the perimeter of each. The roads and background of the image are a very light pink.]()
