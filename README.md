# Genuary 2022

## Day 1: Draw 10,000 of something

![A series of overlapping squares. Each square consists of vertical or horizontal lines, colored in bright blue, green, orange, pinks, and yellows. The lines are not full opacity, so you can see the layers of squares and lines.](01/day_1_noisy_small.png)

## Day 2: Dithering

Gunta St√∂lzl's [Design for a runner](https://2016kingscliffgreendesign.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/gunta-sholzl/)

![A long horizontal design color blocked with various greens, oranges, yellow, and white. There is some fluidity to the design, and the yellow and white blocks are more curved than square. Some of the blocks are patterned with polka dots or stripes. The image is dithered, so the number of overall colors is reduced and the image is represented more in pixels and cross hatches than a smooth photograph would be.](02/gunta_stolzl_2_dither.png)

## Day 3: Space

![A generative image of space. The background is a noisy black to dark grey gradient with tiny randomly placed stars. There are three blobby planets - a dark blue one, a red one, and an orange one in the distance.](03/day_3_noisy_small.png)

## Day 4: The next next Fidenza

![A horizontal image of blobby shapes, alternating in colors of lime green and baby blue to dark blue. There is some flow to the blobs, since their placement is derived from perlin noise.](04/bluegreens_noisy_small.png)

## Day 6: Trade styles with a friend

Referencing (blatantly) Ijeamaka Anyene's [work](https://twitter.com/ijeamaka_a/status/1454885928967696387)

![A set of 4 panels in a combination of vertical and horizontal layout. Each panel is a solid blue square with a thick lime green border and a thinner blue border around that. Within each panel is a bunch of small lime green circles, varying in size and placed randomly. The circles are contained within each panel but there is some overlap with the panels' borders and small number peeking out. On those peeking out, you can see that the circles have a blue border.](06/day_6_noisy_small.png)

## Day 7: Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings

Inspired by [Wall Drawing 413](https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing413/)

![24 sets of squares laid out in 8 columns and 3 rows. Each set contains 4 squares (2 columns and 2 rows), and each square contains 4 squares within it - one red, one lime green, one pink, and one dark blue. The first squares within each sets are all of the possible permutations of the colour placements. The remaining 3 squares in each set are rotations of the first square (i.e. the square mirrored on the x axis, on the y axis, and on both the x and y axes).](07/day_7_noisy_small.png)
