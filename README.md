# Genuary 2022

## Day 1: Draw 10,000 of something

![A series of overlapping squares. Each square consists of vertical or horizontal lines, colored in bright blue, green, orange, pinks, and yellows. The lines are not full opacity, so you can see the layers of squares and lines.](01/day_1_noisy.png)

## Day 2: Dithering

Gunta St√∂lzl's [Design for a runner](https://2016kingscliffgreendesign.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/gunta-sholzl/)

![A long horizontal design color blocked with various greens, oranges, yellow, and white. There is some fluidity to the design, and the yellow and white blocks are more curved than square. Some of the blocks are patterned with polka dots or stripes. The image is dithered, so the number of overall colors is reduced and the image is represented more in pixels and cross hatches than a smooth photograph would be.](02/gunta_stolzl_2_dither.png)

## Day 3: Space

![A generative image of space. The background is a noisy black to dark grey gradient with tiny randomly placed stars. There are three blobby planets - a dark blue one, a red one, and an orange one in the distance.](03/day_3_noisy.png)

## Day 4: The next next Fidenza

![A horizontal image of blobby shapes, alternating in colors of lime green and baby blue to dark blue. There is some flow to the blobs, since their placement is derived from perlin noise.](04/bluegreens_noisy.png)
