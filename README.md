# Genuary 2022

## Day 1: Draw 10,000 of something

![A series of overlapping squares. Each square consists of vertical or horizontal lines, colored in bright blue, green, orange, pinks, and yellows. The lines are not full opacity, so you can see the layers of squares and lines.](1/day_1_noisy.png)

## Day 2: Dithering

Gunta St√∂lzl's [Design for a runner](https://2016kingscliffgreendesign.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/gunta-sholzl/)

![A long horizontal design color blocked with various greens, oranges, yellow, and white. There is some fluidity to the design, and the yellow and white blocks are more curved than square. Some of the blocks are patterned with polka dots or stripes. The image is dithered, so the number of overall colors is reduced and the image is represented more in pixels and cross hatches than a smooth photograph would be.](2/gunta_stolzl_2_dither.png)
